time_filter.py      filter on the time domain.
                    unit test for this code needs data file cube.npy, which is generated by spin_cube.py

spin_cube.py        code that generate depth image sequence of a spin cube

head_dep.csv        unit test data for space_filter.py (depth image from TOF camera)
head_amp.csv        unit test data for space_filter.py (amplitude image from TOF camera)
