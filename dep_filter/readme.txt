filter API for depth image
--------------------------
space_filter.py     example of opencv based spatial filter for single depth image
time_filter.py      filter on the time domain.
                    unit test for this code needs data file cube.npy, which is generated by spin_cube.py

spin_cube.py        code that generate depth image sequence of a spin cube

head_dep.csv        unit test data for space_filter.py (depth image from TOF camera)
head_amp.csv        unit test data for space_filter.py (amplitude image from TOF camera) 


usage
-----
please check the unit test in the end of file space_filter.py & time_filter.py
note that u need to run spin_cube.py to generate cube.npy before run unit test code of time_filter.py
